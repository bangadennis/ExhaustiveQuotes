• if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live
the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in
common hours. He will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more
liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; and he will
live with the license of a higher order of beings – Henry David Thoreau

• Principle-centered people are constantly educated by their experiences. They read,
they seek training, they take classes, they listen to others, they learn through both
their ears and their eyes. They are curious, always asking questions. They
continually expand their competence, their ability to do things. They develop new
skills, new interests. They discover that the more they know, the more they realize
they don’t know; that as their circle of knowledge grows, so does its outside edge
of ignorance. Most of this learning and growth energy is self-initiated and feeds
upon itself. Principle-Centered Leadership—Stephen R. Covey
