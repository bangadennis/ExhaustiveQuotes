                            “Do one thing every day that scares you.”—Eleanor Roosevelt
As year’s end approaches, one tends (well, I tend) to think a little bit philosophically. To
do the accounts of the year past—and to imagine the year to come. As I began that not
(for me) very systematic process, I stumbled across the Eleanor Roosevelt remark above.
And it got me thinking—the whole point. To add a little fuel to the fire I mined a few old
presentations for more spurs to both reflection and forethought. What emerged, in ever so
haphazard a fashion, follows. It is not a listing of “business quotes,” though 100% are
applicable to business. It is not a set of “motivational quotes” (perish the thought), though
most are in some sense motivational. I guess it simply is what it is ... some comments that
may help you, if you’re so inclined, to ruminate on where you’ve been and where you
might go in 2006:

A man approached JP Morgan, held up an envelope, and said, “Sir, in
my hand I hold a guaranteed formula for success, which I will gladly
sell you for $25,000.” “Sir,” JP Morgan replied, “I do not know what is
in the envelope, however if you show me, and I like it, I give you my
word as a gentleman that I will pay you what you ask.” The man agreed
to the terms, and handed over the envelope. JP Morgan opened it, and
extracted a single sheet of paper. He gave it one look, a mere glance,
then handed the piece of paper back to the gent. And paid him the
agreed-upon $25,000.
