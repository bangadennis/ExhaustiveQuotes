Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we
are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most
frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented,

playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about
shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all
meant to shine, as children do.
